# Getting Started<a name="GetStarted"></a>

The following topics will help you set up a nondefault VPC quickly\. If you already have a default VPC and you want to get started launching instances into it \(and not creating or configuring a new VPC\), see [Launching an EC2 Instance into Your Default VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html#launching-into)\.

If you want resources in your VPC to communicate over IPv6, you can set up a VPC with an associated IPv6 CIDR block\.
